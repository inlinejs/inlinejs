## Inlenejs - javascript library

Inlinejs is a javascript library that allows you to write asynchrous code in logical synchrounous order.
This is done by using futures and running a callchain in the background.

The purpose is:
 - To avoid the spaghetti code that results from many nested callbacks
 - To make a code with mutiple asynchrous callbacks easy to reason and maintain
 - To make it easy to control the flow of asynchrous code
 - To make it easier to reuse asynchronous code
